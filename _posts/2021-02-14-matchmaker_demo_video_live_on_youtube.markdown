This is a brief walkthrough of my Matchmaker::Matchmaker CLI. The best part was making my blooper reel.

Development was definitely hampered by my reliance on publicly available APIs with access limits. Since Matchmaker processes a string of API calls, I quickly hit the 5-10 per hour limit on my free API access. This was all the worse because I was pulling different data every time I made a call, so I couldn't stitch together the video once I started working with a text string if an error stopped the flow.

 I'm sure I could have saved countless hours had I just paid $5 for more than enough API calls. 
 
 One day I shall learn.
