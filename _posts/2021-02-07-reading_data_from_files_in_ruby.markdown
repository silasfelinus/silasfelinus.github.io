My current project is Matchmaker, a simple little app to bridge two different APIs. Its specialty is text, since that's within my achievable scope as a solitary programmer, but in my head, the app could be used as a bridge for any two APIs, especially across devices.

You know that scene in the sci-fi movie when the hero is using an augmented-reality interface, grabs a piece of digital information from one screen, and then tosses it into a screen on a completely different display? That's my Big Idea model for Matchmaker.  (If you want a use-case that doesn't require hanging out in Tony Stark's lab: imagine shooting a picture with your phone, then using Matchmaker to send the photo with text to Facebook, Instagram, a folder on your desktop, and Reddit, with the text automatically translated into the language(s) of your choice).

I definitely see a future where AR displays become commonplace and we need much better UI protocols for transfering information. As is, I'm partly trying to solve for a problem that hasn't fully surfaced yet. Which is a good thing, because I'm currently equipped to grab random jokes from the internet, translate them into "Pirate" and then again into Braille. 

Because clearly that was a niche that needed covering.
