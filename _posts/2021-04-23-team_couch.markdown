This article divides post-Covid groups between Team Yes (external socializing is nourishing, staying home is draining) and Team Couch (staying home is nourishing, external socializing is draining). 


I’m definitely, resolutely Team Couch these days; partly because of parenthood and responsibilities pulling me home, but I’ve come to accept that a lot of those drives were deep yearnings that have only now had space to manifest: 
I moved frequently growing up, the oldest child of three, with a single mother doing everything she could (welfare, food stamps, section-8) to get herself a college education and keep us sheltered and fed and loved. My mother did an incredible job, and I learned how to thrive in chaos and be responsible for a home. I was, as a teenager, disturbingly responsible: I didn’t drink or smoke pot until I was almost 22 (except for one party at 17 when I got tipsy, an incident I immediately reported when I got home). 

When I finally started venturing out in the world, it was a floodgate: I was “Team Hell Yes”. I discovered a new interest in being seen, and a curiosity for human behaviors that would befit an alien anthropologist (I thought I knew a lot about humans as I had observed their rituals obsessively on television, but the simulations, while helpful as a guide for surface interactions, were deeply, sometimes insidiously, flawed about certain assumptions).

I found that I was good at socializing. Human beings fascinate me, and they are the only animals that will answer my probingly personal questions about their lives. I have, over the years, met a great number of people that have helped me grow, and I have tried, sometimes poorly, sometimes selfishly, sometimes awkwardly, sometimes helpfully, to be a friend in return. People have taught me to be generous, to be truthful, to be considerate and caring...I may not always succeed, and my failures haunt me, but I appreciate that we are not islands, and we need each other to thrive.

Yet while I see those benefits.... there is still a deep part of me that will always feel safest and most true when I am home. I have spent too much time with myself, sitting alone, watching or reading a story about the world, hoping to glean knowledge. I’m now in my 40’s, and I’ve finally got a home I am proud of, I have human beings to share it with, and I’m really excited that soon enough there’ll be live game nights and outdoor movies and hot tubs and opportunities to sit with friends in a pile on the couch and cuddle. 

I am Team Couch. I may not be super excited about venturing out into the world, but I can’t wait to let more of you into back into mine. ❤️
