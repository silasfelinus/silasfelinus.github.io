As a child, I loved learning. But even  more importantly. I loved showing off how much I'd learned, especially to my peers, which is to say, the teachers, who often seemed to be the only ones around me that seemed to care about the important things in life: like facts and word definitions and memorizing the multiplication table.

As you might expect, I was an annoying child, completely inconsiderate of my classmates, oblivious to variations in skillsets, and entirely validated by a competitive drive to be seen as the smartest person in the room. It didn't take me long to realize that the strongest competition came from the teachers, and the high of taking down a so-called "educator" became the new rush. I'd listen attentively, waiting to pounce with whatever factoid I'd memorized.

Actually, I probably  didn't *learn* a lot in those moments, I was too focused on the attack. That's the problem with being a know-it-all: it doesn't left room to learn anything. I stayed in school a long time, flitting from topic to topic, gaining just enough information to impress a layperson, and moving on before I had to actually stretch myself. I thought I wanted a classical education, but I really just wanted it to look like I had a classical education (as evidenced by my extensive reading of the Time Life Classics Illustrated comic books).

This is, ultimately, a coding blog, so I should mention that I did a decent amount of coding during these stretches. But I could never focus on a single language, or learn any of the more technical (IE, boring) skills that would allow me to turn my hobby into a career. I dabbled in robotics, VR, statistical modeling, game design...but I had no fundamentals, and I lacked the humility to admit that I might need to actually work if I wanted to learn something.

And yet, here I am, embarking on journey to gain enough skills to market myself as a professional coder. But this time, I'm self-paced (through an  incredible education plan with [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/)), and most days the only person I have to impress is myself. And honestly, I'm finding that it's not always easy. I've grown accustomed to achievement through comparison. I might be the smartest person in the room, but I'm also the only one in the room, and I want to evolve.

There are so many things I do not know, so I will try to be humble.

There are so many people with skills I do not have, so I will try to listen.

I will try to ask questions.

I will try to ask for help.

I am a student, and I am here again, for the first time.
